# my-first-code
# This is my first code I uploaded to GitHub.
# I am new to GitHub and like to learn how to use it for my projects.
# I am now 62 years old and basically never wrote any code except some small VBA stuff with EXCEL.
# I have started to learn C++ about 4 years ago. My goal is to gain more knowledge for writing code in C++.
# I really like the language C++ and therefore wrote this few lines of code I just uploaded to GitHub.
# Learning C++ is not that easy as I thought. Specifically because I don't learn on a regular basis. I use only online tutorials.
# But I learn it step by step as I try to understand the features by writing some C++ code. And try to fix the error messeages when compiling.
